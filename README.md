<h1> Study on Hansen (2015) paper "Punishment and Deterrence: Evidence From Drunk Driving" using Stata <h1>

For my postgraduate work at the LSE, I replicated Hansen's 2015 paper: "Punishment and Detrerrence: Evidence from Drunk Driving". This replication was odne using Stata. Above is the code for the analysis done, along with the figures created.

This way, I will be comparing a method that is often used for Data science (CRISP-DM), Software Engineering (SCRUM) and a hybrid (TDSM). The Criteria I will be using to justify my choice of SCRUM is:
